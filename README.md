# Assignment_Intro_HDS_2024
 Rapport Infant Death in Scotland

Aims
The aim of this assessment is to apply the data science skills you have developed to an example healthcare problem.

Learning Outcomes
This assessment aligns with the intended course learning outcomes:

1. Communicate information from health data in written form

2. Explain how data science is used to address healthcare problems

4. Apply the data science workflow using R to healthcare problems

5. Discuss the limitations and assumptions made in health data science projects

Weighting
This assessment is summative. It will contribute 70% of your final course grade.

Due Date
Tuesday December 3rd, 11pm

Instructions
Description
You are asked to produce a data visualisation report that aims to highlight a healthcare problem in Scotland (or at an individual health board or council area within Scotland), using any data from the Scottish Public Health Observatory which has not been previously used in the course. The data visualisation should be between 1 and 3 graphs, as needed to tell the story to your target audience. (Keep in mind that more graphs is not necessarily better.)

Format
An R analysis should be written in R Markdown, and should contain all the required steps in the data science workflow, from the initial data acquisition to the final data visualisation. Make sure you use appropriate formatting and code documentation. Convert your report to pdf (by “knitting” it in R) and submit the pdf to MyAberdeen, not the original R markdown file.

Remember that to "knit" to pdf, you need to have LaTeX installed on your computer. If you don't already have it, you can install the tinytex package: install.packages("tinytex")

After that you'll need to restart Rstudio and run: tinytex::install_tinytex()



In your R Markdown report, include a summary addressing the following points:

Who is your target audience, and what is the key message you are aiming to get across (with your chosen visualisations)?
What data did you use to produce your visualisation? What are the data limitations?
What are the strengths and limitations of the approach you took for your visualisation?
Word Count / Length
There is a 500 word limit for the report summary section, not including references. You will not be penalised for going under the limit as the ability to write succinctly is a skill we hope to develop as scientists; however you will be penalised for exceeding the limit. The penalty to be applied will be based on the word count over, for every 100 words over you will be penalised by 1CGS point i.e. proposals between 2001 and 2100 will lose 1 point, 2101 and 2200 – 2 points and so forth.

There is no word limit for the rest of the R analysis, including comments.
