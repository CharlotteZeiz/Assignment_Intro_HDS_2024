# Infant mortality in Scotland\

For this assignment, I wanted to look into the data from the **Scottish Public Health Observatory** regarding changes and geographical patterns in infant mortality. "The infant mortality rate is defined as the number of children who die before reaching their first birthday in a given year, expressed per 1 000 live births." ([OECD/World Health Organization (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1787/health_glance_ap-2018-8-en)). Ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under the age of five is one of the World Health Organisations sustainable development goals [1].\ 
My target audience are health officers working in the NHS or the councils, as they could initiate further research or data acquisition.
The dataset used for this assignment was extracted from the [ScotPHO Online Profiles Tool](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/ScotPHO_profiles_tool/) and is freely available for the public. 
For additional analysis on geographical patterns, two datasets from  **Public Health Scotland** were added: 
1. the Urban-Rural-Classification was used to display differences in mortality rate between urban an rural areas in six categories (https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/urban-rural-classification)
2. to link both datasets, a codes and labels dataset from (https://opendata.scot/datasets/public+health+scotland-geography+codes+and+labels/)\

##Preparation
###Load packages
```{r load packages, message=FALSE} 
#loading the packages i used most during the course
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(viridisLite)
```

###Read data from ScotPHO
```{r load data scotpho, message=FALSE}
#Read in data from ScotPHO

library(readr)
infant_death_all_geo <- read_csv("ScotPHO_infantdeath_all_update.csv")
```

###Inspect data
```{r inspect, message=FALSE}
glimpse(infant_death_all_geo) #to see what data dataset contains
any(is.na(infant_death_all_geo)) #to see if there are missing values (FALSE = no NA)
```

##Data cleaning
```{r Clean data, chose variables, message=FALSE}
#Selecting values i need for my first visualisation

mortality_allgeo <- infant_death_all_geo %>% 
  select(area_code, 
         area_type, 
         area_name, 
         year,
         measure,
         upper_confidence_interval,
         lower_confidence_interval) %>% 
  rename(mortality_rate = `measure`,
         upper_ci = `upper_confidence_interval`,
         lower_ci = `lower_confidence_interval`) 
```

## Infant mortality rate in Scotland between 2004-2019
###Graph 1
This line graph shows the evolution of the infant mortality rate. Between 2004 and 2018 we can observe a reduction in infant mortality, in 2019 the rate got slightly higher again.
```{r visualize infant mortality rate 2004-19}
#visualize graph 
library(ggplot2)
mortality_allgeo %>% 
  select(year, mortality_rate, area_type) %>% 
  filter(area_type == "Scotland") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = mortality_rate), linewidth = 1)+
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Infant mortality per 1000 live births") +
  theme_bw()+
   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5)) #adjusting the scale to include zero -> more realistic visualisation
```
###Graph 2
```{r select data and create boxplots to show evolution and variability of infant mortality, message=FALSE}

Population density and infant mortality

According to the mid 2019 population estimates (https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/statistics/population-estimates/mid-19/mid-year-pop-est-19-report.pdf), the four most dense populated
