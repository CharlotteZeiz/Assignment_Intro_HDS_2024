# Infant mortality in Scotland\

For this assignment, I wanted to look into the data from the **Scottish Puclic Health Observatory** regarding infant mortality. "The infant mortality rate is defined as the number of children who die before reaching their first birthday in a given year, expressed per 1 000 live births." [OECD/World Health Organization (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1787/health_glance_ap-2018-8-en). Ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under the age of five is one of the World Health Organisations sustainable development goals [1].\
The dataset used for this assignment was extracted from the [ScotPHO Inline Profiles Tool](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/ScotPHO_profiles_tool/) and is freely available for the public.\

```{r load packages}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
```
```{r load data from scotpho}
library(readr)
infant_mortality_all_geo <- read_csv("ScotPHO_infant death all geo.csv")
View(infant_mortality_all_geo)
```
```{r prepare data variables}
mortality_allgeo <- infant_mortality_all_geo %>% 
  select(`area_type`, `area_name`, `year`,`numerator`) %>% 
  rename(Year = `year`,
         Mortality_rate = `numerator`
         )
head(mortality_allgeo)
```


## Evolution of infant mortality in Scotland
```{r graph 1 prep}
mortality_scotland_total <- mortality_allgeo %>% 
  select(`area_name`, `Year`,`Mortality_rate`) %>% 
  filter(`area_name` == "Scotland")
```

```{r graph mortality scotland trend}
library(ggplot2)
mortality_scotland_total %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = `Year`, y = `Mortality_rate`))
```
Our available data shows a downward trend in the mortality rate in Scotland between the years 2004 and 2019.
